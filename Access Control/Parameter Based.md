# Parameter-based access control methods

Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:

A hidden field.
A cookie.
A preset query string parameter.

The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example:
```bash
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1
```
This approach is insecure because a user can modify the value and access functionality they're not authorized to, such as administrative functions.
