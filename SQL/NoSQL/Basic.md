# NoSQL injection
NoSQL injection is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to interfere with the queries that an application makes to a NoSQL database. NoSQL injection may enable an attacker to:
1) Bypass authentication or protection mechanisms
2) Extract or edit data.
3) Cause a denial of service.
4) Execute code on the server.

NoSQL databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL relational tables. They use a wide range of query languages instead of a universal standard like SQL, and have fewer relational constraints.
